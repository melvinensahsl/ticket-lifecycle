Customer Karen submitted a ticket, and agent John upgraded the SLA to a more acceptable level depending on the problem's urgency. Agent John updated the assistance topics to better reflect the customer's circumstance and assigned them to the online banking team. Agent Jane takes up the case alone. She communicated with the customer until they resolved the issue, and then she closed the ticket.
